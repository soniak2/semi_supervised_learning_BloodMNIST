# Semi-Supervised Learning on BloodMNIST Dataset

This project explores semi-supervised learning techniques for medical image classification using the **BloodMNIST** dataset. The main goal was to train a neural network (ResNet-based) capable of learning effectively from **partially labeled data**.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** [BloodMNIST](https://medmnist.com/) â€” a subset of MedMNIST containing blood cell images for classification.
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network based on **ResNet architecture**.
- **Approach:** A custom Python class was implemented to handle **semi-supervised training**, combining labeled and unlabeled data during the learning process.
